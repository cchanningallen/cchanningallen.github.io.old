### What am I trying to convey here?

Really, set the site's tone:

  * understandable, eloquent, concise.

  * serious topics addressed with a twinkle in the eye.

Hey there! I'm Channing. Welcome to my small corner of hyperspace.

I created this place to share musings and record experiences. Topics tend to cluster around subjects that sing to me:

  * exploring and seeking to comprehend this beautiful, beautiful world
  * unlocking my most fulfilled self
  * improving the human experience on a macro scale, for *all* socio-economic strata
  * the simple joys found in creation, presence, and authentic self-expression.

Each entry has served me in some way.  I hope they do the same for you.

Thank you for visiting. You are always welcome.

( *Big virtual hug* )<br>
Channing
